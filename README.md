# Final-assignment
Testing two GET endpoints of API (WordsAPI). (1) GET a word; 2) GET a word details)
Request for the first endpoint: GET https://wordsapiv1.p.mashape.com/words/{word} 
I input word and get its definition, part of speech, syllables, derivation.
 It's needed to check this request works correctly:
1) for different parts of speech
3)
